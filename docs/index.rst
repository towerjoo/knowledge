Welcome to Tower Joo's knowledge database
===============================================

   I love python and python related stuffs, e.g django, sphinx and etc.

   To make everything in a good state, I use sphinx to generate the docs to server as
   a knowledge management system.

   The content will include the stuffs I learned in the college life and working life.
   And the tips to remind me to prevent forgetting.

.. note::

    Thousands of times' reading is less than one time's writing.

        -- quotted from a Chinese old proverb

    眼过千遍，不如手过一遍.
