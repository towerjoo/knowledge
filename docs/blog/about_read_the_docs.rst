About the Great Read The Docs
==================================


"Hey, I've started to use `RTD`_ to `do my knowledge management`_."

I read the blog article from `Eric`_'s `Announcing Read The Docs`_ days ago and
I set up my online doc system 2 days ago. And `RTD`_ is really amazing! You can:

* write your docs using `sphinx`_
* host your doc in any service with mainstream source management system support(git, mercurial or svn)
* push to the server and the online doc will update in real time
* it's written in `Django`_ (Check out the source code from `github`_)!

Why not to set up your own and it's free!
